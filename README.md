# Boston House Price Prediction

## Introduction
This notebook will help you to implement multivariate linear regression. When there are more than one input features to the model then we have to use multivariate linear regression to take every independent variables into account for finding the dependent variable.

## Dataset
I have loaded the dataset from the sklearn's dataset package using the following code.  
<code> from sklearn.datasets import load_bosten </code>

## Issue/Bug
Please open issues on github to report bugs or make feature requests.

## Contribution
If you are interested in improving the code, please open an issue first to describe the task you are planning to do. For small fixes (a few lines of change) feel free to open pull requests directly.
